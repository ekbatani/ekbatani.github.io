I try to create Second Brain in some major topics of my life. Building a Second Brain methodology will teach you how to:

    1-  Consistently move your projects and goals to completion by      organizing and accessing your knowledge in a results-oriented way.
    2-  Transform your personal knowledge into income, taking advantage of a rapidly growing knowledge economy.
    3-  Uncover unexpected patterns and connections between ideas.
    4-  Reduce stress and “information overload” by expertly curating and managing your personal information stream.
    5-  Develop valuable expertise, specialized knowledge, and the skills to deploy it in a new job, career, or business.
    6-  Cultivate a collection of valuable knowledge and insights over time without having to follow rigid, time-consuming rules.
    7-  Unlock the full value of the wealth of learning resources all around you, such as online courses, webinars, books, articles, forums, and podcasts.
